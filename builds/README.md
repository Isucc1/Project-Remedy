    - Added:
        - Added watcher enemy type
            Has a circle around it that if you enter, it will try and kill you; otherwise it just sits and chills at its origin point
        - Added Forest level type (really more of a plains but still)
            Stole some art from someone online; placeholder obviously. Mainly using it to test out AI and pathfinding stuff
        - Added random enemy spawner
            Spawns anywhere between 1 and 7 watcher enemies randomly around the level. Will likely get stuck until I refine the code later
        - Several things are weird and broken; the most problematic one I know of is the crash in puzzle test when trying to interact with the NPC.
