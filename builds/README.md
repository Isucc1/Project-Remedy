<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Latest Build:  9/5/24

    Added:
        - Pause Menu
            Just click it with the left mouse button to open it, didn't feel like making it P or Esc or anything.
            Not the prettiest, and the code very stolen from the main menu but I think it works. Just don't try to go into another room from the debug options.
            There's currently a change values button in the debug options; doesn't do anything right now, same as Settings, but will hopefully be able to change stats of characters while still in game, and in a simpler way so game testers can change it themselves to see what feels good and won't have to rely on me making a new build for every subtle change to the class's stats.
            Haven't actually tested the debug options myself so you know here be dragons and all that
        - Button icons to the bottom right of main menu
            I_was_me was complaining about not knowing space bar was confirm so there
        - Fixed the unlocked classes not displaying in the top right
            Didn't even notice this was missing until I changed something for debugging lol

Build 9/8/24

- Changelog
    - Stat editor
        Change stats of the currently selected class
        Just pause the game (by clicking the pause button with the mouse), select debug options, and "Edit statsvalues" (supposed to be stats/values but i dont have a / in the font lmao)
        Wont show the currently selected stat, but you'll figure it out once you press A or D (left/right)
    - Other stuff changed
        I changed several things behind the scenes, if something is broken i have no clue lmao
    - Somehow broke some parts of the camera
        it works fine for the most part still, but several things that are supposed to be stuck to the camera kinda jitter when you move; ie the pause button, the player, that's all i've noticed
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
