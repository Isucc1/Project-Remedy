Build 8/31/24

- Added:
    - Pause Menu
        Just click it with the left mouse button to open it, didn't feel like making it P or Esc or anything
        Not the prettiest, and the code very stolen from the main menu but I think it works. Just don't try to go into another room from the debug options
        There's currently a change values button in the debug options; doesn't do anything right now, same as Settings, but will hopefully be able to change stats of characters while still in game, and in a simpler way so game testers can change it themselves to see what feels good and won't have to rely on me making a new build for every subtle change to the class's stats
        Haven't actually tested the debug options myself so you know here be dragons and all that
    - Button icons to the bottom right of main menu
        I_was_me was complaining about not knowing space bar was confirm so there
    - Fixed the unlocked classes not displaying in the top right
        Didn't even notice this was missing until I changed something for debugging lol
